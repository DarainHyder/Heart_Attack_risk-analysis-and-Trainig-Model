# Heart_Attack_risk-analysis-and-Trainig-Model
This project focuses on analyzing heart attack risks using Probability and Statistics (PnS) concepts. It includes data cleaning, statistical hypothesis testing, and predictive model training to classify individuals at risk. The dataset is preprocessed to remove inconsistencies, and various statistical tests are conducted to determine key factors affecting heart attack risks. The project also visualizes data using graphs for better insights.

Key Features
✅ Data Cleaning – Handles missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
✅ Hypothesis Testing – Applies statistical tests to validate key assumptions.
✅ Model Training – Uses classification techniques to predict heart attack risks.
✅ Data Visualization – Generates informative graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
✅ Statistical Analysis – Includes point-biserial correlation, proportion Z-tests, and normal distribution analysis.

Dataset
The dataset (Heart Attack.csv) consists of multiple features related to patient health.
It includes age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical indicators.
The target variable is whether an individual is at high risk of a heart attack.
Technologies Used
🔹 Python – Primary language for data analysis
🔹 Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation and numerical operations
🔹 Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
🔹 Scipy & Statsmodels – Statistical testing and hypothesis validation
